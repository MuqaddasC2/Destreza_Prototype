# Destreza: An Advanced Disease Simulation Platform (Prototype)

üîó [View Live Demo](https://euphonious-phoenix-d841db.netlify.app/)

This is a prototype for Destreza, a sophisticated disease transmission simulator prototype that showcases cutting-edge UI/UX design and modern web development practices. The core simulation engine and force-directed graph are placeholder components, not intended for further development. The project is meant to showcase exceptional frontend architecture and interactive visualization design.

For the fully functional version with a working disease simulation and force-directed graph, refer to the main [Destreza project](https://github.com/MuqaddasC2/Destreza_Disease_Simulator).

## User Interface

The interface combines modern aesthetics with functional design, featuring a stunning landing page with dynamic particle effects that respond to user movement. The UI employs a dark theme with vibrant accent colors, creating an immersive and futuristic experience. Interactive elements and smooth animations provide immediate visual feedback, while the responsive design ensures a seamless experience across all devices.
